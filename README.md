# ZTH1-Pacman
Pac-Man game for the ZTH1 RISC micro-computer

This is an implementation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game for the ZTH1 RISC micro-computer,
as implemented on a Kamami Maximator FPGA board. This repository contains the source code written
in ZTH1 assembly-language (which can be processed by the ZTH1 assembler), as well as the object code
in the form of .mif files for the instruction ROM and the two data RAM banks (these files have to be copied
into the folder of the ZTH1 Intel Quartus Prime project). Playing the game requires an HDMI monitor and a
4-direction joystick that has to be connected to the Arduino I/O port of the Maximator board.
